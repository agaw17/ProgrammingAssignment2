## Functions may be used for inverse matrix calculation in fast way, 
## as if an inverse matrix was once calculated it takes previosly calucates value form a cache

##  makes a special object - creaters a definitions for getting a matrix, setting a matrix, 
## store inverse matrix and get inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## gives an inverse matrix, either by calculating it or by getting from cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
